# 🏫 A study repository to learn Data Science tools and technologies. 🫡

## List of tools and technologies used until now

    * scikit-learn
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * matplotlib

## Demos of machine learning models

this is a list of machine learning models that I have implemented in this repository. I have implemented these models using `scikit-learn library`.

> each demo have a evaluation of the model using `sklearn.metrics` module.

### supervised learning

#### classification

- [x] k-Nearest Neighbors
- [x] Decision Tree Classifier
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] Random Forest Classifier

#### regression

- [ ] Linear regression
- [ ] Polynomial regression
- [ ] Decision tree regression
- [ ] Random forest regression


### unsupervised learning

- [ ] K-means
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- [ ] Hierarchical clustering
- [ ] Association rules
