# 🏫 A study repository to learn Data Science tools and technologies. 🫡

## List of tools and technologies used until now

* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Demos of machine learning models

This is a list of machine learning models demos that I have implemented (or intend to) in this repository. I have implemented these models using `scikit-learn library`.

> Each demo have a evaluation of the model using `sklearn.metrics` module.

### Supervised learning

#### Classification

- [x] K-Nearest Neighbors
- [x] Decision Tree Classifier
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] Random Forest Classifier

#### Regression

- [ ] Linear regression
- [ ] Polynomial regression
- [ ] Decision tree regression
- [ ] Random forest regression


### Unsupervised learning

- [ ] K-means
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- [ ] Hierarchical clustering
- [ ] Association rules

## Demos of relacional databases
